            Wachtell Liptonâ€™s tax attorneys regularly advise clients on the tax
            aspects of corporate reorganizations, acquisitions, spin-offs and
            other dispositions, joint ventures, financings, and restructurings.
            <br />
            <br /> These transactions frequently involve large multinational
            businesses and raise complex domestic and multinational tax issues.
            Tax considerations often determine the form and the viability of
            contemplated transactions. In current distressed market conditions,
            we work together with our corporate and restructuring and finance
            departments to restructure existing financial arrangements,
            including those arising out of private equity and other leveraged
            transactions. We also are involved in creating new financial
            products and in innovative real estate transactions and are
            considered preeminent in all of the areas in which we are involved.
            Our tax attorneys regularly publish and lecture on emerging tax
            issues and actively participate in the work of tax policy groups,
            such as the Tax Section of the New York State Bar Association and
            the International Fiscal Association.
