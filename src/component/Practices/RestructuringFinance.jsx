          <h2>Restructuring and Finance</h2>
          <p>
            Wachtell Lipton’s unique, integrated restructuring and finance
            practice combines deep expertise in both disciplines. The result is
            unmatched experience in acquisition financing, distressed mergers
            and acquisitions, capital structure design, liability management,
            restructurings and workouts, insolvency litigation and debt-related
            activism. We know how capital structures work under ideal conditions
            and under stress, enabling us to help our clients throughout the
            life cycles of their investments.
          </p>
          <h3>Restructuring</h3>
          <h3>A Premier Insolvency Practice</h3>
          <p>
            We are regularly involved in the most high-profile insolvency
            matters in the United States and around the world. We represent
            major creditors, including banks and investment firms, in chapter 11
            cases and out-of-court restructurings. Our experience goes beyond
            conventional bankruptcy filings and workouts: during the 2008 U.S.
            mortgage crisis, Wachtell Lipton represented the United States
            Treasury in connection with the rescues of Fannie Mae and Freddie
            Mac and we have represented lenders to the Puerto Rico Electric
            Power Authority through the utility’s case under the historic Puerto
            Rico Oversight, Management, and Economic Stability Act. Recent
            substantial restructuring engagements can be found here.
          </p>
          <h3>Distressed Mergers and Acquisitions</h3>
          <p>
            We advise clients on acquisitions and divestitures of businesses in
            financial distress and other strategic transactions involving
            debtor-creditor issues, bringing to bear the full expertise of both
            our restructuring and our preeminent mergers and acquisitions
            practices. We regularly represent buyers in “section 363” bankruptcy
            sales as well as debt investors in change-of-control transactions
            both in chapter 11 and out of court. We wrote the book on Distressed
            M&A.
          </p>
          <h3>Specialized Litigation Expertise</h3>
          <p>
            We have an extensive record representing major parties in litigation
            relating to bankruptcy cases and other debt-related issues. We
            represented JPMorgan Chase in the successful defense of
            multi-billion dollar actions brought by the Lehman Brothers estate,
            the trustee for Bernard Madoff’s brokerage firm and the unsecured
            creditors committee of General Motors. We successfully defended
            Campbell Soup, at trial and on appeal, from fraudulent transfer
            litigation arising out of the Vlasic spin-off. The Campbell Soup
            decision is now the leading precedent relating to valuation in
            fraudulent transfer cases. We also represented Education Management
            in litigation arising out of its out-of-court restructuring,
            including its successful, precedent-setting appeal in the Marblegate
            case.
          </p>
          <h3>Finance</h3>
          <h3>A Market-Leading Acquisition Finance Practice</h3>
          <p>
            Our firm focuses on financing complex and transformative corporate
            transactions, including mergers, acquisitions, divestitures and
            spin-offs, however accomplished: bank debt and capital markets
            transactions, investment grade and high-yield. <br />
            <br /> Year after year, we lead many of the largest and most
            complicated financing transactions in the U.S. and around the world.
            Recent substantial financing engagements can be found here. <br />
            <br />
            Capitalizing on our extensive experience in corporate deal-making
            and corporate distress, Wachtell Lipton has become a pioneer in
            developing acquisition financing platforms that help our clients
            weather the ups and downs in the business cycle and give them the
            flexibility to execute on their business plans and to grow
            organically and through future deals.
            <br />
            <br /> The breadth and depth of our market exposure ensures that our
            clients benefit from the best available terms and market trends and
            permits us to craft negotiating strategies designed to achieve these
            terms while maximizing speed and minimizing execution risk.
          </p>
          <h3>Liability Management and Activism</h3>
          <p>
            Our firm has advised numerous companies and financial sponsors in
            connection with exchange offers and other liability management
            transactions. Recent representations include Intelsat in connection
            with $6 billion of exchange and refinancing transactions; Abbott
            Laboratories in its registered exchange offer for $3.1 billion of
            notes issued by St. Jude Medical in connection with Abbott’s
            acquisition of St. Jude; and Sears in connection with a variety of
            refinancing transactions and exchange offers. <br /> <br />
            We are thought leaders on issues relating to activism in the debt
            markets, advising clients, including Intelsat, in responding to
            activist strategies, including default claims and strategies
            relating to credit default swaps and other short positions.
