          <h2>Litigation</h2>
          <h3>A National and International Litigation Practice</h3>
          <p>
            We have represented clients in some of the world’s largest and most
            complex disputes, including domestic and cross-border deal
            litigation, corporate governance disputes, white collar and
            regulatory defense, commercial litigation, securities litigation,
            bankruptcy litigation, complex settlements, appeals, and
            arbitration. Our litigators have a long history of handling
            cutting-edge merger litigation, including many of the most
            significant takeover defense battles in history. We are called upon
            to play a central role in high stakes and high profile matters
            generally, including litigation related to the tragic events of
            9/11, the recent financial crisis, and other litigations with
            fundamental consequences for our clients. We also assist our clients
            with sensitive internal and law enforcement investigations. In
            addition, our litigators engage in significant pro bono activity at
            both the trial and appellate court levels, write and speak in areas
            of expertise, and teach at the nation’s top law schools.
          </p>

          <h3>Our Approach to Litigation</h3>
          <p>
            A tight-knit group of approximately 75 lawyers, we approach each
            matter with intensity, thoroughness and creativity and build teams
            appropriate to the circumstances. We approach our clients’ legal
            issues within the larger framework of their strategic, business, and
            financial goals. We specialize in matters that require careful
            attention, tested experience, and a high degree of expertise. We
            handle litigation at all stages, from pre-suit counseling and
            investigations through trials and appeals. Engagements undertaken by
            the Firm are at all times afforded the direct personal attention of
            partners possessing relevant expertise. Our approach is to achieve
            the best result for the client as quickly as possible. We regularly
            take cases to trial and win before judges, arbitrators and juries.
            But we also know when it makes sense to settle, and we have
            structured some of the largest and most complex litigation
            settlements to date.
          </p>
          <h3>Takeover and Merger Litigation</h3>
          <p>
            We are known for trendsetting takeover, transactional, and corporate
            governance litigation. We litigated the Revlon, Household, and other
            cases in the 1980s that set the doctrinal framework for all
            subsequent deal litigation. And the Firm continues to lead in the
            area — year after year, Wachtell Lipton handles the most important
            corporate governance and takeover cases in the nation, from the
            seminal case Corwin v. KKR Financial, which recognized the merger
            ratification defense to the successful Airgas trial (in which the
            court reaffirmed the “poison pill” takeover defense against a
            generation of attack) to the successful Vulcan trial (in which the
            Firm secured an unprecedented order enjoining a hostile takeover
            bid) to the successful Sotheby’s defense of the company’s
            shareholder rights plan against an activist investor attack; to
            Allergan’s closely watched takeover battle with Valeant and Pershing
            Square, resulting in a groundbreaking preliminary injunction that
            set new federal precedent against unfair tactics in takeover bids.
            Other leading merger cases the firm has litigated include: Paramount
            Communications, Inc. v. Time, Inc.; Paramount Communications, Inc.
            v. QVC Network, Inc.; and IBP, Inc. v. Tyson Foods. In recent years,
            our litigators also have led the charge against appraisal arbitrage
            litigation, securing post-trial victories in the appraisals of
            Ancestry.com, SWS Group, PetSmart, and AOL. And we have been the
            thought leaders behind innovative corporate litigation developments
            in books-and-records suits and stockholder forum-selection bylaws.
          </p>
          <h3>Complex Commercial and Securities Litigation</h3>
          <p>
            Our approach to complex commercial and securities litigation also
            exemplifies our focus on fresh thinking and creative solutions and
            the fact that we are called upon to handle some of the nation’s
            biggest and most complex cases. We represented National Australia
            Bank in the landmark Morrison case, in which the United States
            Supreme Court held that Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act
            and SEC Rule 10b-5 apply only to purchases and sales of securities
            in the United States. The decision overturned 40 years of
            lower-court precedent and eradicated a burgeoning species of
            securities litigation (so-called “foreign-cubed” and
            “foreign-squared” class actions) along with billions of dollars in
            potential liability for foreign securities issuers. We successfully
            defended Goldman Sachs in Baker v. Goldman Sachs, a five-week jury
            trial in federal court in which co-founders and major shareholders
            of a speech-recognition software company, Dragon Systems, were
            challenging Goldman’s investment banking advice and seeking over
            half a billion dollars in damages. We helped Bank of America contain
            its mortgage exposures arising from the financial crisis, including
            by negotiating Bank of America’s landmark $8.5 billion settlement of
            claims involving more than 500 trusts for mortgage-backed securities
            issued by Countrywide and in resolving multibillion dollar claims
            arising from the foreclosure crisis with the federal government and
            49 state attorneys general. Following the tragic events of 9/11, we
            were called upon to represent the leaseholder of the World Trade
            Center in two jury trials with its property insurers that ultimately
            helped it secure enough money to rebuild the site. And we continue
            to represent Philip Morris USA in arbitrations and litigation that
            have arisen under the landmark 1998 settlement between the major
            tobacco companies and 52 states and territories. Wachtell Lipton
            previously had the lead role structuring and negotiating this more
            than $200 billion settlement.
          </p>
          <h3>Bankruptcy and Restructuring Litigation</h3>
          <p>
            We have a long and successful record representing major parties in
            litigation relating to bankruptcy cases and other debt-related
            issues. We have represented major companies in the successful
            defense of actions brought by bankruptcy trustees and creditors. We
            represented JPMorgan Chase in: (1) the Lehman Brothers bankruptcy,
            where the Firm obtained summary judgment dismissing $8.6 billion of
            estate claims; (2) the Bernard Madoff liquidation, where the Firm
            obtained dismissal of claims by the trustee seeking $18 billion in
            damages; and (3) the General Motors bankruptcy, where we
            successfully defended the bank at trial from fraudulent transfer
            claims seeking $1.5 billion. We represented Campbell Soup at trial
            and on appeal in defeating a fraudulent transfer challenge to the
            spin-off of Vlasic Pickles. On behalf of Education Management, the
            Firm defeated an attempt to enjoin the company’s $1.5 billion
            restructuring and won a precedent-setting appeal from a judgment
            under the Trust Indenture Act. We have represented private equity
            firms, hedge funds, and other clients in significant contested
            matters arising in chapter 11 cases, including Toys “R” Us and
            Energy Future Holdings. We also represent companies in defending
            litigation and default claims by activist debtholders.
          </p>
          <h3>White-Collar and Regulatory Enforcement</h3>
          <p>
            We have a leading white-collar criminal and regulatory practice. We
            have represented major financial institutions and multinational
            corporations, as well as their boards of directors and senior
            executives, in a broad range of the most complex and typically
            high-profile white-collar criminal and regulatory enforcement
            matters, both nationally and internationally. In the past few years
            alone, our litigators have handled both U.S. and foreign
            governmental investigations focusing on the Foreign Corrupt
            Practices Act, criminal tax evasion, criminal transfer pricing, the
            False Claims Act, insider trading, securities fraud, accounting
            fraud, criminal antitrust, and export control violations. In
            addition, we regularly represent boards, audit committees, and
            special committees charged with conducting special investigations in
            response to whistleblowers or governmental inquiries.
          </p>
          <h3>Pro Bono</h3>
          <p>
            We have an active pro bono litigation practice. Our lawyers are
            encouraged to take on pro bono matters with the full support of the
            Firm and many take advantage of this opportunity. We have
            represented abused women seeking protection, indigent criminal
            defendants in the state and federal courts, immigrants seeking
            asylum, and non-profit organizations challenging government action.
            We file amicus briefs on significant legal issues on behalf of
            business groups and others. On behalf of the Chief Judge of the
            State of New York, we represented the state’s judiciary in historic
            and successful litigation over the state’s failure to increase the
            pay of its judges since 1999. We took on one of the earliest cases
            challenging the military’s policies discriminating against gay
            service members.
