          matters. Our practice is comprised of a dedicated core of attorneys
          with deep experience with high-stakes issues confronting financial

          joint ventures, enforcement actions, internal investigations,

        <h3>Corporate Governance</h3>
        <p>
          We are thought leaders in the area of corporate governance. We have

          standards and corporate governance initiatives for listed companies.
          We have represented a number of major corporations in connection with
          corporate governance and related matters; we have also advised special
          committees of boards of directors, including the boards of Novartis,
          Publicis and National Australia Bank, in connection with corporate
          governance investigations and related matters. We regularly advise
          boards and management teams on matters concerning sustainability, ESG
          and corporate purpose.
