          <h2>Executive Compensation and Benefits</h2>
          <p>
            Wachtell Liptonâ€™s executive compensation and benefits attorneys work
            closely with the most senior executives of our largest clients to
            address the most sensitive issues facing public and private
            companies both in the deal and non-deal contexts.
            <br />
            <br /> Management succession, board composition and similar issues
            are essential to the success of business combinations, and executive
            compensation arrangements often are the foundation of people-based
            businesses. Our practice continues to evolve as tax rules,
            securities laws and corporate governance standards relating to
            executive compensation continue to expand in response to scrutiny by
            shareholder activists and the popular press.
