            acquisitions and government investigations, including international
            antitrust and banking antitrust issues

            <br /> Our department analyzes transactions to determine whether
            they raise antitrust issues, develops strategies to address those
            potential concerns, and represents clients before the U.S.
            Department of Justice, the Federal Trade Commission, the Board of
            Governors of the Federal Reserve System, state attorneys general and
            foreign antitrust enforcement authorities, and in litigation
            challenging transactions on antitrust grounds. Our department takes
            a leading role in virtually all of the mergers and acquisitions in
            which we are involved.
