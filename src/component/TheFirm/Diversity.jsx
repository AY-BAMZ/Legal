            lldel Law is a charter member of the Law Firm Antiracism
              Alliance, a program created to leverage the resources of the
              private bar to amplify the voices of communities and individuals
              oppressed by racism, to better use the law as a vehicle for change
              that benefits communities of color and to promote racial equity in
              the law and in government institutions.
            </li>

              We actively encourage and support affinity group meetings among
              our attorneys. While informal in nature, these forums have proven
              to be a good way for attorneys to get together to discuss shared
              concerns and work toward a common goal. Currently, we have groups
              that represent our Women, Women of Color, African-American/Black,
              Asian, Hispanic/Latinx, LGBTQ, Parents and Veteran attorneys.
