          <p><span>
          lldel Law was founded on a handshake in 1965 as a small group
            of lawyers dedicated to providing advice and expertise at the
            highest levels.</span> <br /><br /> We have achieved extraordinary results following the
            distinctive vision of our founders — a cohesive team of lawyers
            intensely focused on solving our clients’ most important problems.
            We have experience in the fields of mergers and acquisitions,
            strategic investments, takeovers and takeover defense, shareholder
            activism, corporate and securities law and corporate governance. We
            handle some of the largest, most complex and demanding transactions
            in the United States and around the world. We counsel both public
            and private acquirors and targets. We also handle sensitive
            investigation and litigation matters and corporate restructurings,
            and counsel boards of directors and senior management in critical
            situations. We have a track record of original and groundbreaking
            solutions and innovations that have had a dramatic impact on
            business and law. We are thought leaders. Our distinctive structure
            defines our approach. We maintain a ratio of associates to partners
            significantly below that of other firms. We focus on matters that
            require the attention, extensive experience and sophistication of
            our partners. We limit the number and type of matters we undertake.
            Our system of lock-step compensation promotes a careful selection of
            matters as well as the flexibility to bring the right expertise to
            bear without regard to factors extrinsic to providing the best
            service and advice. We work together on a task-force basis on all of
            our matters, bringing to bear the requisite mix of people and
            expertise across practice areas. Our structure and approach attract
            talented and entrepreneurial lawyers, who enable us to achieve
            excellent results for our clients in complex and critical matters.
