            our firm has represented a number of indigent women in their family
            court battles with abusive spouses; we take on prominent public
            interest matters. For example, on behalf of the Chief Judge of the
            State of New York, we represented the state’s judiciary in historic
            and successful litigation over the state’s failure to increase the
            pay of its judges since 1999. We took on one of the earliest cases
            challenging the military’s policies discriminating against gay
            service members. And, we frequently assist nonprofit organizations
            in a variety of corporate and organizational matters. For example,
