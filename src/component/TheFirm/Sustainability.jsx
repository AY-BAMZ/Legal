            Wachtell Lipton is committed to sustainability and environmental
            stewardship. We appreciate the impact our operations have on the
            environment and have taken steps to make our operations more
            sustainable and reduce our overall carbon footprint. <br /> <br />
            We are proud that our sustainability and environmental program,
            which supports high-quality carbon reduction projects, has enabled
            us to offset carbon emissions associated with employee travel and
            our electricity consumption through the use of Renewable Energy
            Certificates (RECs). We are committed to making the world a greener
            and more sustainable place.
