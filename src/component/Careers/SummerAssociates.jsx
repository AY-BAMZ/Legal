          <h2>Summer Associates</h2>
          <p>
            As our current summer associate program comes to a close, we look to
            select a new, small group of highly qualified students for our next
            summer associate program. Our objective is to give our summer
            associates an experience as close as we can to that of a new
            associate. We make every effort to expose summer associates to all
            facets of our practice and involve them actively in negotiations,
            client meetings, courtroom and deposition sessions and travel. Since
            a primary objective of the program is to give the summer associate a
            chance to get to know us, summer associates rotate over the course
            of the summer through several of our practice areas. Our summer
            associates are free to choose those practice areas that interest
            them most.
