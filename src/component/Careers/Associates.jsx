          <p>
            For over a decade,  lldel Law has ranked in The
            Vault Law 100 as one of the most prestigious firms in the country,
            as well as first in New York City, and is ranked number one in M&A.
            Moreover, in the American Lawyer’s survey of midlevel associates our
            firm has ranked among the highest in the country in such categories
            as partner-associate relations, interesting work and benefits and
            compensation. Thus being an associate at our firm is a sought after
            opportunity for top graduates of the nation’s most prestigious law
            schools. Importantly, we recognize the critical role that associates
            play in our success. Our culture reinforces the respect we feel for
            our associates by giving them substantial responsibility, close
            working relationships with partners and clients, state-of-the-art
            support and a long-term commitment to their professional
            development. The result of this unique combination of sophisticated
            practice, intellectually charged atmosphere and people-oriented
            culture is a group of associates who are enthusiastic about working
            at  lldel Law.
            <br />
            <br /> We have always maintained a low ratio of associates to
            partners. This structure allows us to avoid the kind of hierarchical
            assignment structure that often prevails at more “leveraged” firms.
            The firm’s size and structure affords our associates the opportunity
            to quickly take on meaningful responsibilities which allows them to
            become highly valued members of small teams working directly with
            clients; as a result, competition or “one-upmanship” among
            associates has never been an issue — a true team spirit prevails.
            Given the nature of our practice and, in particular, the absence of
            repetitive, standardized transactions and matters, we train
            associates to be complete, well-rounded lawyers as opposed to
            specialists in subparts of particular transactions or matters; in
            short, we try to develop in each of our associates the skills
            necessary to become a partner in our firm.
            <br />
            <br />
            Our relatively small size and unusual partner-to-associate ratio
            allows each associate the opportunity to work directly with partners
            in an informal and non-structured atmosphere that encourages
            hands-on training and the development of close working relationships
            among lawyers of the firm and our clients.
            <br />
            <br />
            We prize independent thinking and creativity in our associates; our
            relatively small size and unusual structure are designed to create
            an engaging, high-energy atmosphere in which these traits will
            develop and flourish.
            <br />
            <br />
            We provide our attorneys with the necessary support and technology
            to allow for the practice of law at the highest and most responsive
            level. In addition to the systems infrastructure in place in the
            office, we provide each attorney with a laptop and a smartphone. We
            also support remote access on a worldwide basis to allow connection
            to the office and all of our information resources.
            <br />
            <br />
            Our Associate Development Committee (ADC) is dedicated to providing
            an exceptional workplace that fosters associates’ professional
            development in a collegial and supportive environment. The ADC’s
            mentoring program supports the training of new associates and their
            acculturation into the firm. Each new associate is assigned an
            associate and a partner mentor upon joining the firm. Additionally,
            all associates are assigned a class dean, who ensures that
            associates receive work experience of appropriate breadth and
            intensity, as well as sufficiently detailed feedback about their
            progress in acquiring the skills necessary to succeed at the firm.
            <br />
            <br />
            All new associates starting in the fall participate in a week-long
            orientation and training program designed to introduce them to firm
            practices and procedures and bridge the gap between law school and
            the practice of law. Individual departments offer specialized
            training as it relates to their practices. In addition, a variety of
            Continuing Legal Education programs are offered in-house throughout
            the year to help keep attorneys abreast of the latest developments
            and legal issues.
            <br />
            <br />
            Although the majority of our current associates were former summer
            associates, we also consider and welcome applications from
            attorneys, including judicial law clerks.
